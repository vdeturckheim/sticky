The sticky server

This server is an example of multiple uses of [Glue](https://github.com/hapijs/glue) related to [this feed](https://github.com/dwyl/learn-hapi/issues/44).
The whole project is made of:
* [sticky_auth](https://github.com/vdeturckheim/sticky_auth) (please do not use this as en acample for hapi auth plugin!)
* [sticky_public](https://github.com/vdeturckheim/sticky_public)
* [sticky_pivate](https://github.com/vdeturckheim/sticky_private) (any similitude with sticky_public would be the result of a shameful laziness of me.)

# Disclaimer

This is jus an example of how I use `glue` multiple time in my usual workflow. Any comments would be welcomed !
